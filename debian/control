Package: librtimulib7
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Versatile C++ and Python 9-dof, 10-dof and 11-dof IMU library (shared library)
 The simplest way to connect a 9-dof, 10-dof or 11-dof IMU to an embedded Linux
 system and obtain Kalman-filtered quaternion or Euler angle pose data.
 Basically, two simple function calls (IMUInit() and IMURead()) are pretty much
 all that's needed to integrate RTIMULib.
 .
 This package provides shared library.

Package: librtimulib-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, librtimulib7 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Versatile C++ and Python 9-dof, 10-dof and 11-dof IMU library (dev files)
 The simplest way to connect a 9-dof, 10-dof or 11-dof IMU to an embedded Linux
 system and obtain Kalman-filtered quaternion or Euler angle pose data.
 Basically, two simple function calls (IMUInit() and IMURead()) are pretty much
 all that's needed to integrate RTIMULib.
 .
 This package provides the development files.

Package: librtimulib-utils
